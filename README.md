Datafile::Simple

Lightweight pure-Perl modules for reading and writing common data files.

* Datafile::Array - Tabular/delimited data with optional CSV quoting
* Datafile::Hash  - Key-value and INI-style config files with sections

No dependencies. Safe atomic writes. Verbose messaging.

See perldoc Datafile::Array and perldoc Datafile::Hash for full documentation.
